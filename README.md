# MarioClone

# Overview
- This project is an assignment from a C++ game programing free course that I learnt on youtube.
- Because of the lack of assets and resources, the project is still incomplete.
- You can watch the course [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7lXSihz0ac&list=PL_xRyXins848nDj2v-TJYahzvs-XW9sVV)

# Installation

### On Linux

You should have the following dependencies installed:
- `git`
- `g++` (or any C++ compiler)
- `make`
- SFML library (3.0)

Steps:
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thkinh/MarioClone.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd MarioClone
   ```

3. Run the setup script:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

   This will automatically build the project and run the game.

### On Windows

1. **Install dependencies:**
   - Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/). 
   - Install a C++ compiler, such as [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).
   - Setup [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php). (>2.0 && <3.0)
    
2. **Switch to the master branch:**

   The Windows build code is on the `master` branch. Run the following command to switch to it:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```
   
3. **Build the project by using VisualStudio:**
  - Open VisualStudio on the MarioClone folder and run.
